Turns out the vessel we were exploring had half its hull sheared off, so when we opened the outer door, we were looking right across the twisted superstructure and out to the full blast of the sun. Idlewild has some serious burns across his face, and it’s unclear if he’ll ever see again, but at least his environment suit wasn’t just a flimsy pressure bladder like Robinson’s. Any crew members wanting to say a few words can do so at 1100 on the E deck airlock.  ",
